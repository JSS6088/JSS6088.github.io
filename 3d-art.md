# ðŸŽ¨ 3D Art

Here are some of my 3D modeling and texturing works, focusing on environment art!


## A Gentlemen's Dispute

_A Gentlemen's Dispute_ is a slapstick physics-based **party brawler** where players fight each other as gentlemen until the last standing. The game offers **highly chaotic gameplay** with hilarious moments emerging from each playerâ€™s growing collection of perks and creative combination of items.

As the primary 3D artist, I'm responsible for **creating game maps** and **managing art pipeline**. Inspired from classic protraits for aristocrats, I art directed the game to have a **painterly look**. To create models efficiently, I ended up made a painterly texture using **Adobe Substance Designer**, check it out here. 

Using the painterly texture tool, I kept on making maps for the game, with more coming in the future!
