## Island
I had fun creating a relaxing vacation beach scene. Since a large proportion of the level is going to be water, I spent most time creating a custom water shader. It has fully adjustable parameters to control the caustic pattern as well as the wave movement. Besides, this is a bigger level, so working in modular mindset is key. Thus, I modelled wooden planks and rocks in different variations, which I could later use to create wooden structures and rock cliffs.

All images or videos are directly taken from unity.

### Breakdown

I followed a modular workflow to construct the scene from multiple base modules. This allows me to create the scene efficiency while achieving high visual fidelity.

I researched on house with thatched roofs as well as rock cliffs for good references on creating those modules.
