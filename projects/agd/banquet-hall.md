## Banquet Hall

Banquet hall is the second map for A Gentlemen's Dispute. I had fun creating a highly decorated place for players to mess up! Most of the models are using the same painterly pipeline. This map is fully interior, so I am taking full adventage of light map baking to create realistic lighting. The lighting design in this map references classic royal dinners to make the place more "gentlemenly".

The torch fire VFX is created by our amazing VFX artist Kevin.
