## The Blast Furnace

Living in Pittsburgh, I am deeply inspired by the Carrie Blast Furnace Landmark and have always wanted to recreate this historic moment in the game. To better understand how blast furnaces work, I paid for several on-site visits and researched their mechanism and role in steel production. It was exciting to see everything come together in the game, and I definitely couldn't wait to see chaotic fights in such a hazardous place!

### Breakdown

Textures are first made in PBR style, then it went through the painterly filter in Substance Designer. This is more efficient than painting the entire texture map from scratch

Warm lighting from lava are baked into lightmaps to save performance.

Walkways are created from several modules to build scene faster.

As the hero asset, I went to do some extra research on how the blast furnace works, especially from Carrie Blast Furnaces.
