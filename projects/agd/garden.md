## Garden

Garden is the first map added to the game that allows me to explore different art styles. Since our players are gentlemen, and this term originates back during Middle Ages when painting was the only 2D representation tool. I chose to texture everything in a non-photorealstic painterly style. I had a lot of fun in coloring models since I can freely paint on them. Overall, this is a great experience to explore and develop a unique artstyle for the game that speaks to players. 

All images or videos are directly taken from unity.

I referenced from both outdoor garden design as well as oil paintings to create such a stylized garden scene.
